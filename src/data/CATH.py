    # CATH Domain Names
    # -----------------
    # The domain names have seven characters (e.g. 1oaiA00).
    #
    # CHARACTERS 1-4: PDB Code
    # The first 4 characters determine the PDB code e.g. 1oai
    #
    # CHARACTER 5: Chain Character
    # This determines which PDB chain is represented.
    # Chain characters of zero ('0') indicate that the PDB file has no chain field.
    #
    # CHARACTER 6-7: Domain Number
    # The domain number is a 2-figure, zero-padded number (e.g. '01', '02' ... '10', '11', '12'). Where the domain number is a double ZERO ('00') this indicates that the domain is a whole PDB chain with no domain chopping.
    #
    #
    # Hierachy Node Representatives
    # -----------------------------
    # Representative structural domains are selected from the CathDomainList based on
    # the numbering scheme. For example the S35 sequence family representatives
    # for superfamily 1.10.8.10 in the above example are 1oaiA00, 1oksA00, 1cuk003,
    # 1p3qQ00 and 1nv8B01 as these are the first instances in the file with the same
    # superfamily number i.e. 1.10.8.10 but all have different S35 numbers (1 to 5).
    #
    #
    #
    # New to CLF Format 2.0
    # =====================
    # Domain ids are now 7 characters long to accommodate chains with more than 9 domains.
    #
    # There is a new sequence family level at 60% sequence identity (column 7)
    #
    # A count for each domain in a S100 sequence family is included (column 10) so that it is possible to represent domains uniquely using the CATH code.
    #
    # C.A.T.H.S.O.L.I.D
    #
    # C - Class
    # A - Architecture
    # T - Topology
    # H - Homologous Superfamily
    # S - Sequence Family (S35)
    # O - Orthogous Seqeuce Family (S60)
    # L - 'Like' Sequence Family (S95)
    # I - Identical (S100)
    # D - Domain (S100 count)
    #
    # Clustering for the CLF uses a directed multi-linkage clustering algorithm and is order by increasing resolution, domain length and domain_id.
